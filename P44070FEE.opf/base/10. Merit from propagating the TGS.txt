[Merit from propagating the TGS]

Then the Exalted One said to the bodhisattva-mahāsattva Vajramati:“Vajramati, sons and daughters
of good family, whoever—whether a layman (gṛhin) or ordained (pravrajita)—learns (*udgṛhṇāti)
this Dharma discourse (dharmaparyāya) [called] Tathāgatagarbha, preserves [it] (*dhārayati),
recites [it] (*vācayati), understands [it] (*paryavāpnoti), arranges [it] into
a book, explains [it] (*deśayati) also to others in detail and teaches [it] (*saṃprakāśayati),
will produce much merit (puṇyaṃ prasavati).”

[Devaluation of external worship]“Vajramati, a certain bodhisattva might apply [himself] to
realize the tathāgata-knowledge, and for the purpose of venerating all buddhas without exception
in every single world system (lokadhātu), [he] would, after achieving supernatural
powers (ṛddhi), attain (samāpadyate) such an absorption (samādhi) that through the power created
by [this] absorption [he could] day by day present (niryātayati) pavilions to every
single existing tathāgata among the buddhas, the exalted ones, even more [numerous] than
the sands of the Ganges River, in myriads (koṭīniyutaśatasahasra) of buddha-fields even more
[numerous] than the sands of the Ganges River, together with [their] bodhisattvas and the
communities of śrāvakas. [To reside in these pavilions would be] pleasant in [every] season.
[Their] width [and length would each be] one yojana, [their] height ten yojanas. [They]
would be made of all [kinds of] jewels, [and would be] heavenly fragrant, being strewn
with a variety of fallen blossoms and furnished with all immaculate (anavadya) objects of
enjoyment (bhoga). [The number of pavilions would be] as many as fifty [times] the sands
of a hundred thousand Ganges Rivers. For fully a hundred thousand cosmic cycles (kalpas) [he]
would show reverence in this way.If [on the contrary] a certain son or daughter of good
family should forge the resolution (citta) to [strive for] awakening (bodhi), and internalize
or arrange into a book (pustaka) only one simile from this Dharma discourse [called]
Tathāgatagarbha, [then], Vajramati, the previously [described bodhisattva’s] accumulation
of merit does not come near by even a hundredth, a thousandth, a hundred thousandth—any number,
any tiny part (kalā), any calculation or any resemblance—to his accumulation of merit
(puṇyābhisaṃskāra); nor does [it] bear any comparison.”

[Superiority of joyful approval of the TGS]“Then, Vajramati, [suppose] a bodhisattva, in searching
(paryeṣate) for the Dharma of the buddhas, strewed four hundred thousand triple-bushels
of flowers of the coral (mandāra) tree for every single tathāgata among the buddhas,
the exalted ones, for fully a hundred thousand cosmic cycles.Vajramati, if [on the contrary]
any monk, nun, upāsaka or upāsikā should decide [to strive] for awakening, and after listening
to this Dharma discourse [called] Tathāgatagarbha raised [their] joined palms and
said [just] the single phrase ‘I joyfully approve [what I have heard]!’ (anumodayāmi), [then]
Vajramati, the previously [described bodhisattva’s] accumulations of merit and benefit,
connected with the offering of flowers and flower garlands, planted among the tathāgatas
[as fields of merit (puṇyakṣetra)], do not come near by even a hundredth, a thousandth, a
hundred thousandth—any number, any tiny part, any calculation or any resemblance—to those
accumulations of merit and benefit; nor do [they] bear any comparison.”

Then at that time the Exalted One uttered these verses:

[10.1] “[Suppose], having brought forth the wish for awakening, a certain sentient being listened
to this [discourse and] learned [it], copied [it] or arranged [it] into a book and explained
[even just] a single verse with appreciation (sagaurava);”[10.2] “or if after listening
to this Tathāgatagarbha[sūtra] somebody searched for this excellent awakening: listen
to [my description of] the benefit (anuśaṃsā) [accruing] to him in these cases—[a description
of] what amount of merit is produced!”[10.3] “[Suppose] a hero (vīra) abiding in these
excellent supernatural powers worshiped for a thousand cosmic cycles the highest of humans
(narottama) and [their] śrāvakas in the ten directions.”[10.4] “[He] would present to
each teacher (ācārya) of the world without exception excellent palaces (vimānaśreṣṭha) made
of jewels—in number several myriad [times the sands of] the Ganges [and] more, unimaginably
(acintya) many.”[10.5] “The [palaces] would be ten yojanas high and one yojana wide and
long, be excellently furnished with fragrances and incense, and inside be provided with
thrones made of jewels.”[10.6] “[These] thrones, and palanquins too, [would be] spread with
silk and calico a hundred [times], as innumerable as [the sands of the] Ganges River; [he]
would present [these palaces with thrones] to each victorious one.”[10.7] “Upon the victorious
ones who reside in world systems—those victorious ones more [numerous] than the sands
of the Ganges River—[he] would thus bestow [these palaces, and] would venerate [them]
all with appreciation.”[10.8] “If [on the contrary] some wise [person], having listened to
this sūtra, learns only one single simile correctly, or having learnt [it], explains [it]
to somebody [else, then] he will [produce] a greater amount of merit thereby [than the previous
person].”[10.9] “Regarding the [former] merit seized by the hero [who worshiped the
tathāgatas, it] does not come near by any tiny part or resemblance [to the merit of this
wise person]. [The wise person therefore] becomes a refuge (śaraṇa) for all living beings,
and he quickly attains excellent awakening.”[10.10] “The wise bodhisattva who reflects upon
[the following]:‘The tathāgatagarbha exists in the same way [in all beings]! This is the
true nature (dharmatā) of all sentient beings,’will quickly become an awakened one [through]
his own power (svayaṃbhū).”
