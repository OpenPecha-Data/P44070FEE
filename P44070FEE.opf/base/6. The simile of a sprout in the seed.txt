[The simile of a sprout in the seed]

“Sons of good family, again it is like the example of a fruit of a mango tree, a rose apple
tree, a palmyra palm or of cane: inside the sheaths of the outer peel there is a seed of imperishable
nature (*avināśadharmin) [containing] a sprout, [a seed] which, thrown on soil,
will become a great king of trees.Sons of good family, in the same way also the Tathāgata
perceives that [sentient beings who are] dwelling in the world are completely wrapped in
the sheaths of the outer peel of [such] defilements [as] desire (rāga), anger (dveṣa), misguidedness
(moha), longing (trṣṇā) and ignorance (avidyā).”

“In this [connection] the true nature (dharmatā) of a tathāgata, being in the womb (garbha)
inside the sheaths of [such] defilements [as] desire, anger, misguidedness, longing and ignorance,
is designated ‘sattva.’When it has become cool, it is extinct (nirvṛta). And because
[it is then] completely purified [from] the sheaths of defilements of ignorance, [it]
becomes a great accumulation of knowledge [in the] realm of sentient beings (sattvadhātu).
The world with [its] gods (sadevako lokaḥ), having perceived that supreme, great accumulation
of knowledge [in the] realm of sentient beings speaking like a tathāgata, recognizes
[him] as a tathāgata.Sons of good family, in this [connection] the Tathāgata perceives that
[all sentient beings]165 are like the [seed containing a sprout], and then propounds the
matter to the bodhisattva-mahāsattvas in order that [they] might realize the tathāgata-knowledge
[within themselves].”

Then at that time the Exalted One uttered these verses:

[6.1] “Just as all the fruits of cane have a cane sprout inside [their seeds], and [just as
a sprout] is also in all the [fruits of] palmyra palms and rose apple trees: when the result,
[which is already perfectly] contained within [the fruit’s outer peel,] is made to germinate,
[a great tree will] grow.”[6.2] “In the same way also the Master of the Dharma, the
Leader, perceives with the supreme, uncontaminated vision of a buddha that in all sentient
beings without exception—similarly to the cane seed—there is the body of a sugata.”[6.3]
“The [being in the state when] the sheaths [of defilements] have not been destroyed is called
‘sattva.’ Even though [the essence of this sattva, namely the body of a sugata,] dwells
[hidden] in ignorance, there is no illusory imagining (manyanā). [It] dwells in absorption
(samādhi), is completely calm and there is no motion whatsoever.”[6.4] “Thinking:‘How
may these sentient beings become awakened—just as a great tree has grown from a seed—and
[thus become] refuges (śaraṇa) for the world with [its] gods?’I speak the Dharma in order
to completely purify [sentient beings].”
