[The simile of a hidden treasure beneath the house of some poor person]

“Sons of good family, again it is as if in the earth beneath a storeroom in the house of some
poor person, under a covering of earth seven fathoms (puruṣa) deep there were a great treasure,
full of money and gold, [of the same] volume as the storeroom. But the great treasure—not
being, of course, a sentient being, given [its lack of] a mental essence—[could] not
say to the poor [man]:‘O man, I am a great treasure, but [I am] buried [here], covered
under earth.’[In his] mind the poor man, the owner of the house, would consider [himself]
poor, and even though [he] walked up and down directly above the [treasure], he [could] not
hear of, know of, or perceive the existence of the great treasure beneath the earth.Sons
of good family, in the same way, [in] all sentient beings, beneath the[ir] thinking, [which
is based on] clinging (abhiniveśamanasikāra)—[and] analogously to the house—there is [also]
a great treasure, [namely] the treasury of the essence of a tathāgata (tathāgatagarbha),
[including the ten] powers ([daśa] balāni), [the four kinds of] self-assurance ([catvāri]
vaiśāradyāni), [the eighteen] specific [qualities of a buddha] ([aṣṭādaśa-] āveṇika[-buddhadharmāḥ]),
and all [other] qualities of a buddha.And yet sentient beings cling to color
and shape (rūpa), sound (śabda), odor (gandha), flavor (rasa) and tangible objects (spraṣṭavya),
and therefore wander in saṃsāra, [caught in] suffering (duḥkhena). And as a result
of not having heard of that great treasure of [buddha] qualities [within themselves, they]
in no way apply [themselves] to taking possession [of it] and to purifying [it].”

“Sons of good family, then the Tathāgata appears in the world and manifests (saṃprakāśayati)
a great treasure of such [buddha] qualities among the bodhisattvas. The [bodhisattvas] then
acquire confidence in that great treasure of [buddha] qualities and dig [it] out. Therefore
in the world [they] are known as ‘tathāgatas, honorable ones and perfectly awakened ones,’
because having become [themselves] like a great treasure of [buddha] qualities, [they]
teach sentient beings the aspects of [this] unprecedented argument [of buddhahood in all
of them] (*apūrvahetvākāra), similes [illustrating this matter], reasons for actions, and
[tasks] to fulfill. [They] are donors (dānapati) [who give from] the storeroom of the great
treasure, and having unhindered readiness of speech (asaṅgapratibhānavat), [they are]
a treasury of the many qualities of a buddha, including the [ten] powers and the [four kinds
of] self-assurance.Sons of good family, in this way, with the completely pure vision of
a tathāgata, the Tathāgata, the Honorable One and Perfectly Awakened One, also perceives
that all sentient beings are like the [poor owner of the house with the hidden treasure] and
then teaches the Dharma to the bodhisattvas in order to clean the treasury [in all sentient
beings, which contains such qualities as] the tathāgata-knowledge, the [ten] powers,
the [four kinds of] self-assurance and the [eighteen] specific qualities of a buddha.”

Then at that time the Exalted One uttered these verses:

[5.1] “[It is] as if beneath the house of a poor [man] there was a treasure full of gold and
money, in which neither motion nor thinking was existent and [which could] not say: ‘I am
yours!’”[5.2] “At the same time a sentient being, the owner of the house, had become poor.
But because [he] would not know [of the treasure] and [because] there was nobody [who] had
informed him, the poor [man] would remain above the [treasure without digging it out].”[5.3]
“In the same way, with the vision of a buddha I see that in all sentient beings—though
[from the outside] they resemble poor [men] —there is a great treasure; and [I see this
treasure] as the motionless body of a sugata.”[5.4] “I see that [treasure and] teach [the
following] to the bodhisattvas:‘O you [bodhisattvas], take the treasury of my knowledge!
Act [so that you may] become treasures of the supreme Dharma, being free of poverty and becoming
protectors of the world (lokanātha)!’”[5.5] “Whoever acquires confidence in [this]
my teaching—in each of those sentient beings is a treasure. Whoever, having acquired confidence,
exerts himself will quickly attain excellent awakening.”
