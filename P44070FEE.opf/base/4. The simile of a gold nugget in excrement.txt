[The simile of a gold nugget in excrement]

“Sons of good family, again it is like the example of a round nugget (piṇḍa) of gold [belonging
to] someone (puruṣāntara) [who] had walked [along] a narrow path, [and whose nugget] had
fallen into a place of decaying substances and filth, [a place] full of putrid excrement.
In that place of decaying substances and filth full of putrid excrement, the [gold nugget],
having been ‘overpowered’ by various impure substances, would have become invisible,
[and would have remained] there for ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred or a thousand
years, [but it would, though surrounded] by impure substances, [never be affected by
them, owing to] its imperishable nature (avināśadharmin). [Because of the covering of impure
substances, however, it could] not be of use to any sentient being.”

“Sons of good family, [if] then a divinity with divine vision looked at that round gold nugget,
[the divinity] would direct a person:‘O man, go and clean that gold of excellent value
[t]here, [which is only externally] covered with all sorts (-jāta) of decaying substances
and filth, and use the gold [in the way] gold is to be used!’In [this simile], sons of good
family, [what] is called ‘all sorts of decaying substances and filth’ is a designation
for the different kinds of defilements. [What] is called ‘gold nugget’ is a designation for
[what] is not subject to perishability (avināśadharmin) [, i.e., the true nature of living
beings]. [What] is called ‘divinity [with] divine vision’ is a designation for the Tathāgata,
the Honorable One and Perfectly Awakened One.Sons of good family, in the same way also
the Tathāgata, the Honorable One and Perfectly Awakened One, teaches the Dharma to sentient
beings in order to remove the defilements—[which are like] all sorts of decaying substances
and mud—[from] the imperishable true nature (dharmatā) of a tathāgata found in all
sentient beings.”

Then at that time the Exalted One uttered these verses:

[4.1] “It is just like [the example of some] man’s nugget of gold [that] has fallen into all
sorts of filth: though it remained there in such a state for not a few years, [yet it would
never be affected owing to its] imperishable nature.”[4.2] “[And] a divinity perceiving
it with divine vision, in order to clean [it], would tell somebody:‘Here is gold of excellent
value! Clean [it] and use it [in the way gold] is to be used!’”[4.3] “In the same way
I [can] see that also all sentient beings have for a long time been constantly overpowered
by defilements, [but] knowing that their defilements [are only] accidental (āgantuka), [I]
teach the Dharma with [appropriate] means in order to purify [their] intrinsic nature (prakṛti).”
