[Setting]At one time I heard the following: In the hot months ten years after [his] complete
awakening (abhisaṃbuddha), the Exalted One (bhagavat) was staying on the mountain Vulture
Peak (Gṛdhrakūṭa) near Rājagṛha, in the Candanagarbha pavilion (kūṭāgāra) of Ratnacchattra
palace (prāsāda), together with a great community of monks (bhikṣusaṃgha), fully a hundred
thousand [in number]. The monks [were both] śrāvakas under training and [those] no [longer
in] need of training; almost all [of them were] honorable ones (arhat) [whose] contaminations
were stopped (kṣīṇāsrava), [who were] free of defilements (niṣkleśa), [who] had attained
mastery (vaśībhūta), [with] completely liberated minds and insight (suvimuktacitta,
suvimuktaprajña), of noble race (ājāneya), [powerful like] great elephants (mahānāga), [whose]
duties were done (kṛtakṛtya), [whose] tasks were performed (kṛtakaraṇīya), [who had]
laid down [their] burden (apahṛtabhāra), [who had] reached their own goal (anuprāptasvakārtha),
[in whom all] the fetters to existence were eliminated (parikṣīṇabhavasaṃyojana), [whose]
minds were completely liberated by perfect knowledge (samyagājñāsuvimuktacitta), and
[who had] attained excellent supremacy in the control over the whole mind (sarvacetovaśiparama-pāramiprāpta).

[Enumeration of the monks][Among] the fully hundred thousand monks were the venerable (āyuṣmat)
Mahākāśyapa, the venerable Uruvilvākāśyapa, the venerable Nadīkāśyapa, the venerable Gayākāśyapa,
the venerable Mahākātyāyana, the venerable Mahā-kauṣṭḥila, the venerable Vakula,
the venerable Revata, the venerable Subhūti, the venerable Pūrṇamaitrāyaṇīputra, the venerable
Vāgīśa, the venerable Śāriputra, the venerable Mahāmaudgalyāyana, the venerable Ājñātakauṇḍinya,
the venerable Udāyin, the venerable Rāhula, the venerable Nanda, the venerable
Upananda, the venerable Ānanda and others.

[Description of the bodhisattvas]Also accompanying him were bodhisattva-mahāsattvas who had
come together from various buddha-fields (buddhakṣetra)—as many as the sands of sixty Ganges
Rivers (ṣaṣṭigaṅgānadīvālukāsama). [They were] all of them [only] one lifetime away [from
perfect awakening] (ekajātipratibaddha) and had attained the [five] great supernatural
faculties, the [ten] powers (bala) and the [four kinds of] self-assurance (vaiśāradya), [had]
venerated many myriads (koṭīniyutaśatasahasra) of buddhas and had set in motion the wheel
of the Dharma [which] never regresses (avaivartyadharmacakrapravartaka). It happened that
sentient beings of immeasurable, innumerable world systems (lokadhātu) attained non-regression
in [their striving after] supreme and perfect awakening (anuttarasamyaksaṃbodhi)
from hearing their names only.

[Enumeration of the bodhisattvas][Among them were] the bodhisattva-mahāsattvas Dharmamati, Siṃhamati,
Vyāghramati, Arthamati, Ratnamati, *Pravaramati, Candraprabha, *Ratna-candraprabha,
*Pūrṇacandraprabha, Mahāvikrāmin, *Aprameyavikrāmin, Anantavikrāmin, Trailokyavikrāmin,
*Acalapadavikrāmin, Mahāsthāmaprāpta, Avalokiteśvara, Gandhahastin, *Gandharati, *Gandharatiśrī,
Śrīgarbha, Sūryagarbha, Ketu, Mahāketu, *Vimalaketu, *Anantaratnayaṣṭi,

*Tyaktaratnayaṣṭi, *Vimalaratnayaṣṭi, Prāmodyarāja, *Sadāpramudita, Ratnapāṇi, Gaganagañja,
Meru, Sumeru, Mahāmeru, *Guṇaratnāloka, Dhāraṇīśvararāja, Dharaṇīṃdhara, *Sarvasattvaroganivartana,
*Prāmodyamanas, *Khinnamanas, *Akhinna, *Jyotiṣkara, Candana, *īhavivarta(na), *Aprameyābhigarjitasvara,
*Bodhi-samutthāpana, Amoghadarśin, Sarvadharmavaśavartin, the bodhisattva-mahāsattva
Maitreya, Mañjuśrī as a young man (kumārabhūta) and other bodhisattva-mahāsattvas,
as many as the sands of sixty Ganges Rivers.

[Other participants]Also accompanying [him] were an immeasurable [number of] divinities (deva),
snake-gods, (tree) spirits, celestial musicians, demons, man-birds, man-horses, serpent-beings,
human beings (manuṣya) and [further] non-human beings (amanuṣya).Then, after the
Exalted One had been surrounded (parivṛta) and honored (puraskṛta) by many hundreds of thousands
of assemblies, [he] was honored, venerated, worshiped and revered by kings, chief
ministers (mahāmātya), guild leaders (śreṣṭhin), noblemen (gṛhapati), ministers (amātya),
citizens (naigama) and country folk (janapada).

[The manifestation of supernatural phenomena]At that time, after having been served food, the
Exalted One withdrew for meditation in that same Candanagarbha pavilion, whereupon through
the power of the Buddha appeared myriads of lotuses [coming out] from the Candanagarbha
pavilion, with myriads of petals, as large as the wheels of carts (śakaṭacakrapramāṇa), colorful
and not [yet] open. The [lotuses] then rose into the sky, covered this whole (sarvāvat)
buddha-field, and remained [there] like a jewel canopy (ratnavitāna).In each calyx of
the lotuses (padmagarbha) was seated, cross-legged (paryaṅka), the body of a tathāgata,
emitting hundreds of thousands of rays of light and visible everywhere. And all the lotuses
were opened up in blossom.

[The fading of the lotuses]Then, by the supernatural power (adhiṣṭhāna) of the Buddha all the
petals of the lotuses, without exception, became dark, deep-black, putrid (durgandha) and
disgusting, and no [longer] pleasing. But in the calyxes of the lotuses the bodies of the
tathāgatas sitting cross-legged and emitting hundreds of thousands of rays of light were
[still] visible everywhere.Further, this whole buddha-field became filled with the [rays
of light from] the bodies of the tathāgatas sitting in the calyxes of the lotuses. This buddha-field
became extremely beautiful [during] that time. Then at that time the whole multitude
of bodhisattvas and the four assemblies were extremely astonished (āścaryaprāpta) and
filled with pleasurable excitement (audbilya-prāpta).

[Doubts of the onlookers][But] after seeing that supernatural display (ṛddhyabhisaṃskāra) of
the Exalted One, [they] became uncertain (saṃśayaprāpta) [and questioned themselves]:“What
is the reason that the petals of all these myriads of lotuses became so unsightly (durvarṇa),
and that the[ir] stalks (nāla) too became unsightly, disgusting and not pleasing, whereas
in the calyxes of the lotuses each body of the tathāgatas is [still] sitting cross-legged,
and in that [they] emit hundreds of thousands of rays of light are visible everywhere
as [something] extremely beautiful?”Thereupon, [the Exalted One] motioned (nimitta) to
the entire multitude of bodhisattvas and the four assemblies who had become uncertain to come
closer. At that time there was a [certain] bodhisattva-mahāsattva named Vajramati [who
had also] gathered [with the others] in the Candanagarbha pavilion.

[Questions of the bodhisattva Vajramati]Then the Exalted One said to the bodhisattva-mahāsattva
Vajramati:“Son of good family (kulaputra), venture to question the Tathāgata, the Honorable
One and Perfectly Awakened One, with reference to an exposition on the Dharma!”At the
Exalted One’s permission, the bodhisattva-mahāsattva Vajramati, realizing that the world
with [its] gods, humans and demons and all the bodhisattvas and the four assemblies, were
anxious with doubts, then asked him the following:“Exalted One, what is the reason this entire
world system is covered with these myriads of such unsightly and putrid lotuses, yet
in their centers sit cross-legged bodies of tathāgatas emitting hundreds of thousands of
rays of light and visible everywhere, and now myriads of living beings, seeing the bodies
of the tathāgatas, raise their joined palms (kṛtāñjali) in homage?”

Then at that time the bodhisattva Vajramati uttered these verses:

[0.1] “Myriads of buddhas are seated motionless in the center of lotuses: [with] such supernatural
powers (ṛddhi) you display [them]. Never before have I seen [anything like] this!”[0.2]
“The [sight] of the leaders (nāyaka) emitting thousands of rays of light, covering this
entire buddha-field [with their splendor, and] wonderfully displaying a facile mastery
of the dharmas, [is] constantly beautiful.”[0.3] “There, in the center of unsightly lotuses
[with] disgusting petals and stalks, sit [tathāgatas], as if they [had] the nature of a
jewel (*ratnasvabhāva). Why have [you with your] supernatural powers (ṛddhi) created these
[manifestations]?”[0.4] “I see buddhas equal in number to the sands of the Ganges River,
[and] I see the exquisite (*viśiṣṭa) [manifestations] of the [Tathāgata’s] supernatural powers.
Never before have [I] witnessed such a miracle (vikurvita) like this one existing right
now.”[0.5] “[I] implore the Highest among Humans (dvipadottama), the Divine (deva), to
teach. [I] implore [him] to explain the reason [for this miraculous display]. [I] implore
[him] to speak [with] solicitude (anukampā) [in order to] benefit the world. [I] implore
[him] to remove the doubts of all embodied [beings] (dehin).”

[Introduction to the first simile]Then the Exalted One said to the whole multitude of bodhisattvas,
[including] the bodhisattva-mahāsattva Vajramati and others:“Sons of good family,
there is a sūtra of great extent (vaipulya) called Tathāgatagarbha. In order to teach it the
Tathāgata has produced these signs [which] appeared [to you]. Listen therefore closely,
be attentive, and [I] will teach [you].”“Just so!” replied the bodhisattva-mahāsattva Vajramati
and the whole multitude of bodhisattvas to the Exalted One, thereby acquiescing, and
the Exalted One spoke:

“Sons of good family, just as these unsightly, putrid, disgusting and no [longer] pleasing lotuses,
supernaturally created by the Tathāgata, and the pleasing and beautiful form of a
tathāgata sitting cross-legged in [each of] the calyxes of these lotuses, emitting hundreds
of thousands of rays of light, [are such that when they are] recognized by gods and humans,
[these latter] then pay homage and also show reverence [to them], in the same way, sons
of good family, also the Tathāgata, the Honorable One and Perfectly Awakened One, [perceives]
with his insight (prajñā), knowledge (jñāna) and tathāgata-vision that all the various
sentient beings are encased in myriads of defilements, [such as] desire (rāga), anger (dveṣa),
misguidedness (moha), longing (tṛṣṇā) and ignorance (avidyā).And, sons of good family,
[he] perceives that inside sentient beings encased in defilements sit many tathāgatas,
cross-legged and motionless, endowed like myself with a [tathāgata’s] knowledge and vision.
And [the Tathāgata], having perceived inside those [sentient beings] defiled by all defilements
the true nature of a tathāgata (tathāgatadharmatā) motionless and unaffected by
any of the states of existence, then says: ‘Those tathāgatas are just like me!’Sons of good
family, in this way a tathāgata’s vision is admirable, [because] with it [he] perceives
that all sentient beings contain a tathāgata (tathāgatagarbha).”
