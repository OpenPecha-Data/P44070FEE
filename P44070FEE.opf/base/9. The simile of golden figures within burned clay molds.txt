[The simile of golden figures within burned clay molds]

“Sons of good family, again it is like the example of figures of horses, elephants, women or
men being fashioned out of wax, then encased in clay [so that they are completely] covered
[with it and finally, after the clay has dried,] melted [in fire]; and after [the wax] has
been made to drip out, gold is melted. And when [the cavity inside the mold] is filled
with the melted [gold], even though all the figures, having cooled down step by step (krameṇa)
[and] arrived at a uniform state, are [covered with] black clay and unsightly outside,
[their] insides are made of gold.Then, when a smith or a smith’s apprentice [uses] a hammer
[to] remove from the [figures] the outer [layer of] clay [around] those figures which
he sees have cooled down, then in that moment the golden figures lying inside become completely
clean.”

“Sons of good family, likewise also the Tathāgata perceives with the vision of a tathāgata that
all sentient beings are like figures [in] clay: the cavity inside the sheaths of outer
defilements and impurities is filled with the qualities of a buddha [and with] the precious
uncontaminated knowledge (anāsrava-jñāna); inside, a tathāgata exists in [all] magnificence.Sons
of good family, having then perceived that all sentient beings are like this, the
Tathāgata goes among the bodhisattvas and perfectly teaches [them] these [nine] Dharma discourses
of that kind[, i.e., on the tathāgata-knowledge within all sentient beings]. [Using]
the vajra[-like] hammer of the Dharma, the Tathāgata then hews away all outer defilements
in order to entirely purify the precious tathāgata-knowledge of those bodhisattva-mahāsattvas
who have become calm and cool.Sons of good family, what is called ‘smith’ is a designation
for the Tathāgata. Sons of good family, after the Tathāgata, the Honorable One and
Perfectly Awakened One, has perceived with [his] buddha-vision that all sentient beings
are like this, [he] teaches the Dharma in order to establish [them] in buddha-knowledge,
having let [them] become free from the defilements.”

Then at that time the Exalted One uttered these verses:

[9.1] “It is like [the example of casting golden images: first, wax] figures are covered outside
with clay; [then, after the wax has been melted and so drips out,] the inside [of the
clay] has a cavity and is empty; [finally,] when [these cavities] are filled with precious
melted materials, [they] turn into many hundreds of thousands [of golden figures].”[9.2]
“[Then] a smith, realizing that [the figures in the clay] have thoroughly cooled down, hews
away the coverings of clay around the figures, thinking:‘What can [I] do so that (yathā)
these [black molds with their insides] made of precious materials may turn into clean figures?’”[9.3]
“In the same way I see that all sentient beings, without exception, are like
golden figures covered with clay: [their] outside crusts are the sheaths of defilements,
but inside there is the buddha-knowledge (buddhajñāna).”[9.4] “[Using] the tool of the Dharma,
[the Tathāgata] then hews away the [defilements of those] bodhisattvas who have become
calm and cool, so that (yena) their defilements are expelled without any remainder.”[9.5]
“[Living beings’ internal] child of a victorious one who has become clean in this [world
are] just like the beautiful precious figures: [their] bodies are filled with the ten powers
[of a buddha], and [they] are venerated here [by] the world with [its] gods.”[9.6] “Thus
I see all living beings; thus I see also the bodhisattvas. Thus purified [by the Tathāgata
they] become sugatas. [Having become] pure sugatas, [they] then teach the rule (netrī)
of the buddhas.”
