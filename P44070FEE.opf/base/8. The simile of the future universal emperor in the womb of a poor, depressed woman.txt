[The simile of the future universal emperor in the womb of a poor, depressed woman]

“Sons of good family, again it is like the example of a woman without a protector (anāthabhūta),
of unsightly complexion, having a bad smell, disgusting, frightening, ugly and like a
demoness (piśācī), [and this woman] had taken up residence in a poorhouse. While staying
there she had become pregnant. And though the life that had entered into her womb was such
as to be destined to reign as a world emperor, the woman would neither question herself with
reference to the sentient being existing in her womb ‘Of what kind is this life [that]
has entered my womb?’, nor would she [even] question herself in that [situation]: ‘Has [some
life] entered my womb or not?’ Rather, thinking herself poor, [she would be] depressed,
[and] would think thoughts [like] ‘[I am] inferior and weak,’ and would pass the time staying
in the poorhouse as somebody of unsightly complexion and bad smell.”

“Sons of good family, in the same way also all sentient beings [think of themselves as] unprotected
and are tormented by the suffering of saṃsāra. [They, too,] stay in a poorhouse: the
places of [re]birth in the states of being. Then, though the element of a tathāgata has
entered into sentient beings and is present within, those sentient beings do not realize
[it].Sons of good family, in order that sentient beings do not despise themselves, the Tathāgata
in this [connection] teaches the Dharma with the [following] words:‘Sons of good family,
apply energy without giving in to despondency! It will happen that one day the tathāgata
[who has] entered [and] is present within you will become manifest. Then you will be
designated ‘bodhisattva,’ rather than ‘[ordinary] sentient being (sattva).’ [And] again in
the [next stage you] will be designated ‘buddha,’ rather than ‘bodhisattva’.’”

Then at that time the Exalted One uttered these verses:

[8.1] “It is as if a simple (bāla) woman without a protector, of bad complexion and ugly disposition
would [go to] stay in a poorhouse, [and] after a time would there have become pregnant,”[8.2]
“[and yet] the [life] that had entered her womb would be such that the [embryo]
was destined [to become] a world emperor king, elevated by [his] magnanimity (mahātmatā)
[and his seven] jewels, and ruling [over all] four continents.”[8.3] “[But] that simple
woman would [behave] like this: [she] would not know if [some life] had entered [her] womb,
rather [she] would [continue to] stay in the poorhouse and pass the time in the belief that
[she] was poor.”[8.4] “In the same way, I see that all sentient beings also [think of
themselves as] unprotected and are distressed by dharmas, [which lead to] suffering, remaining
[caught up] in the lesser pleasures of the three spheres, [even though] inside [them]
there is the true nature (dharmatā)—like [the world emperor in] the womb [of the woman].”[8.5]
“Having seen thus [I] taught the bodhisattvas:‘As all sentient beings do not know about
the true nature (dharmatā) within [their own] wombs [which] grants benefit [to] the world,
[take care of them and let them] not consider themselves inferior!’”[8.6] “‘Apply energy
(vīrya) firmly! Soon you yourselves will become victorious ones. At some point [you will]
attain the essence of awakening. Then [you] will proceed to liberate myriads of living
beings.’”
