[The simile of kernels enclosed by husks]

“Sons of good family, again it is like the example of winter rice, barley, millet or monsoon
rice [whose] kernel (sāra) is shielded all around by a husk (tuṣa): as long as the [kernel]
has not come out of its husk, [it can]not serve the function of solid, soft and delicious
food. But, sons of good family, [it can serve this function very well once] some men or
women, desiring that [these grains serve their] function as food and drink in hard, soft
or other [forms],105 after having it reaped and threshed, remove the [coarse] sheath of the
husk and the [fine] outer skin.”

“Sons of good family, in the same way [that people are aware of the precious kernel within the
husk, so] too the Tathāgata perceives with [his] tathāgata-vision that tathāgatahood, buddhahood,
svayaṃbhūtva—wrapped in the skin of the sheaths of defilements—is [always] present
in every sentient being. Sons of good family, the Tathāgata also removes the skin of the
sheaths of defilements, purifies the tathāgatahood in them and teaches the Dharma to sentient
beings, thinking:‘How [can] these sentient beings become free from all the skins of
the sheaths of defilements [so that they] will be designated in the world as ‘tathāgata,
honorable one and perfectly awakened one’?’”

Then at that time the Exalted One uttered these verses:

[3.1] “[It is] like monsoon rice or winter rice, or [like] millet or barley, [which,] as long
as they are in the husk, [can]not serve [their] function.”[3.2] “[But] having been pounded
[and their] husks having been removed, they [can] serve all [their] various functions.
[However,] the kernels in the husks [can]not serve [any] function for sentient beings.”[3.3]
“In the same way [that people are aware of the precious kernel within the husk,] I see
that the ground of buddha[hood of] all sentient beings is covered by defilements. And then
I teach the Dharma in order to purify them and let [them] attain buddha[hood] quickly.”[3.4]
“In order that [they] may quickly become victorious ones, [I] teach the Dharma so that,
like mine, [their] true nature (dharmatā), which, [though] wrapped in hundreds of defilements,
is in all sentient beings, becomes purified [in] all [of them].”
