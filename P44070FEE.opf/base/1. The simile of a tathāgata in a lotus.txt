[The simile of a tathāgata in a lotus]

“Sons of good family, it is like the example of a person endowed with divine vision [who] would
[use this] divine vision to look at such unsightly and putrid lotuses, not blooming and
not open, and would [owing to his vision] recognize that there are tathāgatas sitting cross-legged
in their center, in the calyx of [each] lotus, and [knowing that, he] would then
desire to look at the forms of the tathāgatas; [he would] then peel away and remove the
unsightly, putrid and disgusting lotus petals in order to thoroughly clean the forms of the
tathāgatas.In the same way, sons of good family, with the vision of a buddha, the Tathāgata
also perceives that all sentient beings contain a tathāgata (tathāgatagarbha), and [therefore]
teaches the Dharma [to them] in order to peel away the sheaths of those sentient
beings [encased in such] defilements [as] desire, anger, misguidedness, longing and ignorance.
And after [those sentient beings] have realized the [Dharma, their] tathāgatas [inside]
are established in the perfection [of the tathāgatas].”

“Sons of good family, the essential law (dharmatā) of the dharmas is this: whether or not tathāgatas
appear in the world, all these sentient beings at all times contain a tathāgata (tathāgatagarbha).Sons
of good family, in view of [this fact and] because [sentient beings]
are encased in the disgusting sheaths of defilements, the Tathāgata, the Honorable One and
Perfectly Awakened One, teaches the Dharma to bodhisattvas and also leads [them] to put
faith in this [revelatory] activity in order to destroy their sheaths of defilements and [thereby]
also completely purify the tathāgata-knowledge (tathāgatajñāna) [contained within].
When (yadā) in this [connection] the bodhisattva-mahāsattvas [who] assiduously apply [themselves]
(abhiyujyate) to these Dharmas have completely become free from all defilements
and impurities, then (tadā) [they] will be designated ‘tathāgata, honorable one and perfectly
awakened one,’ and [they] will also perform all the tasks of a tathāgata.”

Then at that time the Exalted One uttered these verses:

[1.1] “It is as if [there were] a disgusting lotus whose [unsightly] sheath-[like] petals were
not opened out, yet [whose] inside [containing a] tathāgata, were unpolluted [by the petals],
and a person with divine vision perceived [this].”[1.2] “If this [person] peeled away
its petals, in the center the body of a victorious one would appear, and no impurity would
then arise any longer [from this] victorious one. He would appear as a victorious one
[in] the whole world.”[1.3] “In the same way, I also see bodies of victorious ones placed
in the midst of all living beings, encased in myriads of defilements [that are] just like
the disgusting sheaths of a lotus.”[1.4] “[And] because I also desire to remove [the defilements]
of those [sentient beings, I] am continually teaching the Dharma to the wise, thinking,‘May
these sentient beings become awakened!’[And I] purify [their] defilements, so that
[they may become] victorious ones.”[1.5] “My buddha-vision is like that [person’s divine
vision]: with the [vision of a buddha I] see that in all these sentient beings the body
of a victorious one is established, and in order to purify them [I] preach the Dharma.”
