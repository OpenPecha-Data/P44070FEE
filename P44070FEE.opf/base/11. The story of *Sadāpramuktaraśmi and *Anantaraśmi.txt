[The story of *Sadāpramuktaraśmi and *Anantaraśmi]

[The appearance of *Sadāpramuktaraśmi]“Vajramati, again, by way of this [following] kind [of
exposition] (paryāya), [one] should know thus: namely, that this Dharma discourse is extremely
beneficial (bahukara) for bodhisattva-mahāsattvas [because it] will lead to the realization
of the knowledge of an omniscient one (sarvajñajñāna).Vajramati, formerly, in the
past, innumerable, vast, measureless, unimaginable, unparalleled and [quantitatively] inexpressible
cosmic cycles [ago], [and] even more beyond the other side of that [time]—then,
at that time—there appeared in the world the tathāgata, the honorable one and perfectly awakened
one, named *Sadāpramuktaraśmi, realized in wisdom and conduct, a sugata, a world-knowing
one, a charioteer of human beings to be tamed, unsurpassable, a teacher of gods and
men, a buddha, an exalted one.”

[The light from the bodhisattva fills the world systems]“Vajramati, why is that tathāgata called
*Sadāpramuktaraśmi? Vajramati, immediately after the exalted one, the tathāgata *Sadāpramuktaraśmi,
then a bodhisattva, had entered the womb of [his] mother, light was emitted
from [his] body, while [he was still] within the womb of his mother, [so that] in the east
hundreds of thousands of world systems, as many as the atomic-sized dust of ten buddha-fields,
came to be constantly filled with brightness. In the same way, in the [other nine of
the] ten directions, [namely] the south, the west, the north, the southeast, southwest,
northwest and northeast, along with the nadir and the zenith, hundreds of thousands of world
systems, as many as the atomic-sized dust of ten buddha-fields, came to be constantly filled
with brightness. And owing to the pleasant and beautiful light from the body of that
bodhisattva, [which] caused [sentient beings] to rejoice [and] led [them] to delight, as
many as hundreds of thousands of world systems constantly came to be filled with brightness.”

[The light improves sentient beings]“Vajramati, all sentient beings in the hundreds of thousands
of world systems who were touched by the light from that bodhisattva within the womb
of [his] mother attained strength (ojas), beauty (varṇa), mindfulness (smṛti), comprehension
(mati), understanding (gati) and readiness of speech (pratibhāna).All sentient beings in
the hundreds of thousands of world systems who had been born in hells, in animal existences,
in the world of Yama and [as] demons (naraka-tiryag-yoni-yama-lokāsuropapatti) immediately
[could] abandon (cyavate) their birth by virtue of being touched by the light from that
bodhisattva, and were [re]born among gods and men.Those [born as gods and men] by virtue
of being touched [by the light], immediately became incapable of turning back from supreme
and perfect awakening (avaivartikā anuttarāyāṃ samyaksaṃbodhau).In addition, all those
incapable of turning back who had been touched by the light immediately, when touched by
the light, attained intellectual receptivity [to the truth that] dharmas [have] no origination
(anutpattika-dharmakṣānti). [They] also obtained the efficacious formulas (dhāraṇī) called
‘Chapter of the Five Hundred Qualities.’”

[The light makes the world systems delightful]“All those hundreds of thousands of world systems
which had been touched by the light from the body of the bodhisattva within the womb of
[his] mother came to be established as made of beryl, laid out in [the form of] a chessboard
with golden threads, [with] jewel trees coming out of each square, [the trees] having
blossoms, fruits, fragrances and colors.When the jewel trees were shaken and moved by the
wind, such pleasant [and] charming [sounds] came up as there are: the sound ‘Buddha,’ the
sound ‘Dharma,’ the sound ‘religious community’ (saṃgha) [and] the sound ‘bodhisattva,’ along
with the sounds ‘[five] powers (bala) of a bodhisattva,’ ‘[five spiritual] faculties’
(indriya), ‘[seven] branches of awakening’ (bodhyaṅga), ‘liberation’ (vimokṣa), ‘absorption’
(samādhi) and ‘attainment’ (samāpatti). Because of those sounds of the jewel trees, sentient
beings in all of the hundreds of thousands of world systems became and remained satisfied
and joyful. In all the buddha-fields the hells, animal existences, the world of Yama,
and the world of the demons (asurakāya) disappeared.The bodhisattva within the womb of
[his] mother emitted light like the disk of the moon for all those sentient beings. Three
times a day and three times a night [they] raised their joined palms [to pay homage] while
[he] was still in the womb.”

[Why the bodhisattva is named ‘*Sadāpramuktaraśmi’]“Vajramati, when that bodhisattva had been
born, had set out for ascetic life (abhiniṣkramaṇa), and [finally] completely awakened to
buddhahood (bodhim abhisaṃbuddhaḥ), light continued to be emitted in such a way from the
body of that bodhisattva. Even after [his] complete awakening, light continued to be emitted
from the body of that exalted one. Even when the exalted one entered into parinirvāṇa,
that light [from] his body continued to be emitted in the same way. [And] even after that
tathāgata had entered parinirvāṇa and [his body] remained [as] relics (dhātu) in a stūpa,
the light [from his] body [still] continued to be emitted. For this reason, Vajramati, that
exalted one is named the ‘Always Light-Emitting One’ (*Sadāpramukta-raśmi) by gods and
men.”

[The bodhisattva *Anantaraśmi questions the buddha *Sadāpramukta-raśmi]“Vajramati, under the
rule (śāsana) of that exalted one, the tathāgata, the honorable one and perfectly awakened
one, *Sadāpramuktaraśmi—right after [he had become] completely awakened—there appeared a
certain bodhisattva named *Anantaraśmi. [He was accompanied] by a retinue (parivāra) of a
thousand [bodhisattvas]. And, Vajramati, that bodhisattva *Anantaraśmi questioned the exalted
one, the tathāgata, the honorable one and perfectly awakened one, *Sadāpramuktaraśmi,
with reference to this Dharma discourse [called] Tathāgatagarbha.”

[*Sadāpramuktaraśmi teaches the TGS]“In order to benefit (anugraha) the bodhisattvas and to
win [them] over [to his side] (parigraha), the exalted one, the tathāgata, the honorable one
and perfectly awakened one, *Sadāpramuktaraśmi thereupon perfectly explained this Dharma
discourse [called] Tathāgatagarbha for five hundred great cosmic cycles, remaining in the
same seat (ekāsane niṣaṇṇaḥ). And because he perfectly explained to the bodhisattvas this
Dharma discourse [called] Tathāgatagarbha in intelligible (*vijñeya) words [and by employing]
various means (*(abhi)nirhāra) [with regard to the] Dharma, explanations (nirukti) and
hundreds of thousands of similes, [the bodhisattvas] in all world systems in the ten directions,
as many as the atomic-sized dust of ten buddha-fields, understood [this Dharma]
easily (alpakṛcchra).”

[Four bodhisattvas do not attain awakening]“Vajramati, in this [connection] the roots of virtue
(kuśalamūla) [of] all the bodhisattvas who heard this Dharma discourse [called] Tathāgatagarbha,
[or] even (antaśaḥ) only the title Tathāgatagarbha, successively (anupūrveṇa) came
to maturity. Then, in such a way that the marvelous manifestation of the excellent qualities
[of their buddha-fields] conformed to their [roots of virtue, these bodhisattvas] attained
supreme and perfect awakening—apart from four bodhisattva-mahāsattvas.Vajramati, if
you think that then, at that time, the bodhisattva *Anantaraśmi was somebody other [than
yourself, you] should not see it this way! Vajramati, you yourself were then, at that time,
the bodhisattva *Anantaraśmi! Who are the four bodhisattvas who under the rule of that
exalted one have not attained supreme and perfect awakening to buddhahood up until today?
The four are the bodhisattvas Mañjuśrī, Mahāsthāmaprāpta, Avalokiteśvara and you yourself,
Vajramati!Vajramati, this Dharma discourse [called] Tathāgatagarbha is thus of great benefit,
since listening [to it leads] immediately to the realization of buddha-knowledge (buddhajñāna)
for bodhisattva-mahāsattvas.”

Then at that time the Exalted One uttered these verses:

[11.1] “In the past, endless cosmic cycles ago, the exalted one *[Sadā]pramuktaraśmi appeared.
From such light being emitted from his body, myriads of [buddha-]fields came to be illuminated.”[11.2]
“At that time, right after [that] victorious one had attained complete awakening,
the bodhisattva *Anantaraśmi asked that sugata, victorious one and master [for this
discourse, and the latter then] perfectly [and] without pause explained this sūtra.”[11.3]
“All those who happened to hear this sūtra personally from the leader, under the rule (śāsana)
of that [same] victorious one, quickly attained noble awakening—apart from four bodhisattvas:[11.4]
“Mahāsthāmaprāpta, Avalokiteśvara [and], third, the bodhisattva Mañjuśrī.
And you yourself, Vajramati, are the fourth! At that time they [all] heard this sūtra.”[11.5]
“The bodhisattva *Anantaraśmi, who at that time had questioned the victorious one [about
the Tathāgatagarbhasūtra and who] had been tamed by that [same victorious one]—[this]
son of a sugata, Vajramati, was at that time yourself!”[11.6] “I, too, when [I] formerly
practiced the path [of a bodhisattva], happened to hear the title of this sūtra from the sugata
Siṃhadhvaja. [And] having heard [it] with appreciation [I] raised my joined palms.”[11.7]
“By those well-done deeds I quickly attained noble awakening. Therefore wise bodhisattvas
should always learn this excellent sūtra!”
