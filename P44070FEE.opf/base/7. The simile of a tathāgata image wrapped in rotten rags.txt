[The simile of a tathāgata image wrapped in rotten rags]

“Sons of good family, again it is like the example of a poor man [who] has a tathāgata image
the size of the palm of a hand [and] made of seven kinds of jewels. It then so happened that
the poor man wished to cross a [dangerous] wilderness carrying the tathāgata image [with
him]. And in order that it might not be discovered by anybody else, or stolen by robbers,
he then wrapped it in some rotten, putrid rags.Then the man died owing to some calamity
in that same wilderness, and his tathāgata image, made of jewels [and] wrapped in rotten
rags, then lay around on the footpath. [But] travelers, unaware [of the precious tathāgata
image in the rags], repeatedly stepped over [it] and passed by. And [they would] even point
[at it] as something disgusting [and question]: ‘Where has the wind brought this wrapped
bundle of rotten, putrid rags from?’ And a divinity dwelling in the wilderness, having looked
[at the situation] with divine vision, would show [it to] some people and direct [them]:‘O
men, [here] inside this bundle of rags is a tathāgata image made of jewels, worthy
to be paid homage by all worlds. So [you] should open [it]!’”

“Sons of good family, in the same way also the Tathāgata perceives that all sentient beings
are wrapped in the wrappings of defilements and that [they are like something] disgusting,
wandering around for ages throughout the wilderness of saṃsāra. And, sons of good family,
[the Tathāgata] perceives that also within sentient beings [who] are wrapped in the wrappings
of various defilements—and even though [they] may have come into existence as animals—there
is the body of a tathāgata of the same [kind] as my own.Sons of good family,‘How does
the mental vision of a tathāgata (tathāgatajñānadarśana) [in all sentient beings] become
free and completely purified from impurities so that [sentient beings] become worthy of
the homage of all worlds, as I am now?’Thus thinking, the Tathāgata teaches in this [connection]
the Dharma to all bodhisattvas in order to cause [such beings] to become free from
the wrappings of defilements [in which they] are wrapped.”

Then at that time the Exalted One uttered these verses:

[7.1] “It is as if a sugata image were wrapped in putrid, disgusting [materials]—made of jewels
[and yet] wrapped in rags—[and] had been left on a path and lay around [there].”[7.2]
“And the divinity, having perceived it with divine vision, had said to some [people]:‘Here
is a tathāgata [image made of] jewels. Open quickly this bundle of rags!’”[7.3] “My [vision]
is like this divinity’s vision: with that [vision I] see that without exception all these
sentient beings, wrapped in the wrappings of defilements, are suffering severely [and]
are continuously tormented by [this] suffering of saṃsāra.”[7.4] “I perceive that inside
the wrappings [consisting of] defilements the body of a victorious one is firmly established,
that that [body] is without motion and change, and that yet there is nobody setting that
[body] free.”[7.5] “Having seen [this], I then urged [the bodhisattvas]:‘[O you] who have
entered excellent awakening, listen! Thus [is] the essential law (dharmatā) [regarding]
sentient beings: here [within each sentient being] always dwells a victorious one, wrapped
around [with defilements].’”[7.6] “‘When the sugata-knowledge [within] has been set free
and all defilements are pacified, then this [sentient being] is called ‘awakened’ (buddha)
and the hearts of gods and humans are full of joy.’”
