[The simile of honey shielded by bees]

“Sons of good family, again it is as if there were, for example, a round honeycomb hanging from
the branch of a tree, shielded on all sides by a hundred thousand bees and filled with
honey. And a person desiring honey, [and knowing of the honey within,] would then with skill
[in the application of appropriate] means expel all the living beings, the bees, and then
use the honey [in the way] honey is to be used.In the same way, sons of good family, all
sentient beings without exception are like a honeycomb: with a tathāgata’s mental vision
[I] realize that [their] buddhahood within is ‘shielded on all sides’ by myriads of defilements
and impurities.Sons of good family, just as a skillful person by [his] knowledge realizes
that there is honey inside a honeycomb shielded on all sides by myriads of bees, in
the same way [I] realize with [my] tathāgata’s mental vision that buddhahood is without
exception ‘shielded on all sides’ in all sentient beings by myriads of defilements and impurities.”

“And, sons of good family, just like the [person who] removed the bees, also the Tathāgata,
with skill in [the application of appropriate] means (upāyakuśala), removes sentient beings’
defilements and impurities [from their buddhahood] within, [such as] desire (rāga), anger
(dveṣa), misguidedness (moha), pride (māna), insolence (mada), jealous disparagement (mrakṣa),
rage (krodha), malice (vyāpāda), envy (īrṣyā), avarice (mātsarya), and so on. [He]
then teaches the Dharma in such a way so that those sentient beings will not again become
polluted and harmed by the defilements and impurities.[When their] tathāgata’s mental vision
has become purified, [they] will perform the tasks of a tathāgata in the world. Sons of
good family, this is how I see all sentient beings with my completely pure vision of a tathāgata.”

Then at that time the Exalted One uttered these verses:

[2.1] “It is as if there were a honeycomb here, shielded on all sides and hidden by bees, [but]
a person desiring honey would perceive the [honey within] and expel the bees.”[2.2] “Also
here in the same way, all sentient beings [in] the triple states of existence are like
the honeycomb. The many myriads of defilements are [like] the [bees, yet I] see that inside
the defilements there exists a tathāgata.”[2.3] “Also, in order to clean [this] buddha,
I remove the defilements, even as [the person desiring honey] expels the bees. [Using appropriate]
means, [I] teach here dharmas so that myriads of defilements will be eradicated.”[2.4]
“[I do this] in order to induce those [sentient beings], after becoming tathāgatas,
to continually perform the tasks [of a tathāgata] throughout the world, and with readiness
in speech to teach the Dharma, [which is] like a pot of honey from bees.”
