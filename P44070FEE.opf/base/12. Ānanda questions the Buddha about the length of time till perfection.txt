[Ānanda questions the Buddha about the length of time till perfection]

“Vajramati, [when] sons and daughters of good family who are restricted by obstacles [caused
by their] deeds (karmāvaraṇa) listen to this Dharma discourse [called] Tathāgatagarbha, [and
when they] show (uddiśati), recite (svādhyāyati) or teach [it, then]—with regard to listening
to this Dharma discourse, showing [it], reciting [it], explaining [it] and copying
[it]—they will all, seeing the Dharma before their eyes (*pratyakṣa), easily (alpakṛcchra)
become purified [from] the obstacles [caused by their] deeds.”Then the venerable Ānanda
asked the Exalted One the following:“Exalted One, [as for] those sons and daughters of good
family who are not restricted by obstacles [caused by their] deeds and [who] apply [themselves]
(*prayujyate) to this Dharma discourse, from how many buddhas, exalted ones, [do they
preserve] expositions of the Dharma as [persons of] great learning (*bāhuśrutyena) so
that [they] become perfected (niryāta)?”The Exalted One said:“Ānanda, there are sons and daughters
of good family as well who are [already] perfected on account of having preserved
expositions of the Dharma from a hundred buddhas.”

[Perfection through preserving expositions of the Dharma from myriads of buddhas]“Ānanda, [but]
there are also sons and daughters of good family who are [only] perfected on account of
having preserved expositions of the Dharma from two hundred buddhas, three hundred, four
hundred, five hundred, one thousand, two thousand, three thousand, four thousand, five thousand,
six thousand, seven thousand, eight thousand, nine thousand, ten thousand or a hundred
thousand buddhas, [or] even myriads of buddhas.Ānanda, a bodhisattva who preserves this
Dharma discourse, recites [it], perfectly teaches [it] in detail also to others and preserves
[it] as a book should bring forth this thought: ‘I [wish to] attain supreme and perfect
awakening already now!’ He is worthy of the homage and veneration of the world with [its]
gods, humans and demons (asura), as I [am] now.”

[Homage to the one who holds the TGS in his hands]Then at that time the Exalted One uttered
these verses:

[12.1] “When a bodhisattva has heard this sūtra, [he] thinks:‘I [wish to] attain the noble awakening!’He
in whose hands this sūtra is found is worthy of the homage of the world, as I
[am now].”[12.2] “[Being himself] a protector of the world (lokanātha) [and] training [sentient
beings], he is worthy of the praise (praśaṃsya) [of] the leaders (nāyaka) [and] trainers
(vināyaka). Thus he in whose hands this sūtra is found should be called ‘king of the
Dharma.’”<[12.3] “He in whose hands this sūtra is found is worthy of being looked upon [as]
the best of men (puruṣarṣabha), [as] bearer of the lamp of the Dharma (*dharmolkādhārin)
[and] like the full moon. Like a protector of the world, [he is] a foundation [worthy] of
being paid homage.”

[Delight and praise of the onlookers]After the Exalted One had spoken thus, the bodhisattva
Vajramati, the entire multitude of bodhisattvas, the great śrāvakas, the four assemblies and
the world with [its] gods, humans, demons and celestial musicians were delighted, and praised
[what] the Exalted One had said.
